## Purpose

To learn how to use a new software environment with the aim of understanding some principles of different data types and their analysis.


## Introduction

The biological world has got much more quantitative and analytical as the way biology is now performed has changed.  Data volumes have increased markedly, and so has our requirement and ability to analyse such data.  The first part of “Bootcamp” will introduce you to two tools that will be used throughout the course:  the statistical software package R and the UNIX command line.  This will be followed up with a look into data visualisation in the third week.

Week 1 focusses on the statistical software package, R. It will also introduce you to the main software environment for the course – RStudio.  We will look at accessing this environment, using it and learning some basic concepts about data handling through the use of R, focussing on data tables.
