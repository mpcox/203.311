## Lecture Overview


## Conventions used for this RStudio practical

As a reminder, in what follows, we shall use the following typographical conventions for working with `R`:

-   Characters written in `this programming style` are commands to be typed into the computer as they stand.

-   Characters written in _`this programming style`_ are objects and file names.

-   Characters written after something like `###` indicate comments within the code that will help you.  They do not run code. 

-   Characters written in without `>` at the start of the line **(e.g. lines starting with "\[1\]")** indicate responses back from the R console inside RStudio that will help you too. 

-   Words inserted within square brackets **\[Enter\]** indicate keys to be pressed.

So, for example,

```R
 > x <- c(1, 5, 7, 14) [Enter]
```
means \"at the `R` console prompt `>`, type the code as written to make a vector `x` made up of the values 1, 5, 7 and 14, then press the key marked Enter\".

Don\'t forget to press the **\[Enter\]** key: commands are not sent to the `R` console until this is done. There will not be **\[Enter\]** at the end of any of the lines of code in this practical, it is taken that this is to be typed at the end of the line _unless otherwise stated_. It is also assumed that the first `>` is the `R` console prompt.



## Accessing the resources needed

### Computing

#### General

We will be working within web browsers, and Firefox and Chrome are installed on the machines, or Safari if you are an Apple user. We will then login to RStudio Cloud using your personalised account.

#### Manawatu (iMacs)

The machines we are using for the course -- Apple iMacs -- have been updated for 2022, and there is a new login method for them. Usernames and passwords will be supplied to you in the lab, but please remember to ignore (i.e. cancel) the dialogue box about the network when you log in.

#### Albany (PCs)

The machines are Windows PC's so logging into them should be the same as any other Massey Windows PC.

#### outside Massey 

Most likely this is your own machine, so this should not be an issue.

### What we are going to do today?




## Assessment

To reiterate, there is no direct assessment today.  What is required however, is an understanding of the principles we have learnt today, as these will be required for the mastery test which accounts for 15% of the course.  This will take place between Thursday 19-May-2022 and Friday 20-May-2022 online.

The mastery test will test the contents of weeks 7 to 9, more information will follow soon.



## Contact

I have two offices on the Manawatu campus (as I work for both SNS and SoVS), so I am not always in my Science Tower office D5-30. If you want to discuss anything, it's best to email me beforehand.
