# Introduction to UNIX
**Professor Patrick Biggs**

## Purpose

To learn how to use a new software environment with the aim of understanding some principles of the use of command line tools


## Introduction

The biological world has got much more quantitative and analytical as the way biology is now performed has changed.  Data volumes have increased markedly, and so has our requirement and ability to analyse such data.  The first part of “Bootcamp” will introduce you to two tools that will be used throughout the course:  the statistical software package R and the UNIX command line.  This will be followed up with a look into data visualisation in the third week.

Week 2 focusses on an environment used by many computational scientists, those studying biology and many other disciplines.  This environment is the UNIX command line, and takes us back to the days before everything was graphical and ‘point and click’ based.  This is a very powerful and useful way to analyse biological data, and we will start learning the basics of how to work in this different environment.
