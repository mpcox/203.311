# Introduction to UNIX

## Purpose

To learn how to use a new software environment with the aim of understanding some principles of the use of command line tools


## Introduction

The biological world has got much more quantitative and analytical as the way biology is now performed has changed.  Data volumes have increased markedly, and so has our requirement and ability to analyse such data.  The first part of “Bootcamp” will introduce you to two tools that will be used throughout the course:  the statistical software package R and the UNIX command line.  This will be followed up with a look into data visualisation in the third week.

Week 2 focusses on an environment used by many computational scientists, those studying biology and many other disciplines.  This environment is the UNIX command line, and takes us back to the days before everything was graphical and ‘point and click’ based.  This is a very powerful and useful way to analyse biological data, and we will start learning the basics of how to work in this different environment.








## Assessment

To reiterate, for this, the second lab of this course, there is no direct assessment today.  What is required however, is an understanding of the principles we have learnt today, as these will be required for two things:

1. For the mastery test which accounts for 15% of the course.  This will take place on Friday 18-Mar-2022.
2. For a very large part of this course in which you will use RStudio to explore examples of genomic data.

The mastery test will test both Linux and R, so half of the marks will come from each part.  We have not done much biology today, but as a hint have a think about how we can work with biological data that can come in a variety of formats and what we can potentially do with those given what we have learnt today.  There will be a worksheet with test questions for you to work through as preparation for the test.



## Contact

I have two offices on the Manawatu campus (as I work for both SNS and SoVS), so I am not always in my Science Tower office D5-30. If you want to discuss anything, it's best to email me beforehand.
