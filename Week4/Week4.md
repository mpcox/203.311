# Sequencing and Mapping
**Dr Olin Silander**

## Purpose

To learn about the advantages and disadvantages in the three most common types of NGS sequencing data, and how to visualise these differences.


## Introduction

Since the birth of Next Generation Sequencing in 2005 (or so), the technology rapidly proliferated into a number of 
[different platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_parallel_sequencing "NGS sequencing platforms") (e.g. 454, IonTorrent, Helicos, and others). However, this number has been gradually weaned down, and currently there are three dominant NGS sequencing platforms: [Illumina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina,_Inc. "Illumina on Wikipedai"), which dominates the market; [PacBio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Biosciences "PacBio on Wikipedia"); and [Oxford Nanopore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Nanopore_Technologies "Oxford Nanopore on Wikipedia").
These three technologies differ considerably in their methdologies and sequencing output.
