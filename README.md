# Welcome to Genome Science

**This practice-oriented course will differ from many of the other courses you have taken. We will focus heavily on the hands-on computational skills you need to extract biological information from large 'omics datasets, including transcriptomes, metagenomes and more. Delivered primarily through a range of practical activities, this course is assessed solely through assignments, and spans topics including the dynamic nature of the genome through to sequence analysis, data visualization and data interpretation. This introduction to computational analysis is geared towards biologists and assumes no previous knowledge or familiarity with computational methods.**
