# Genome Science 203.311

**This advanced course focuses on the practical computational skills needed to extract biological information from the genome and associated â€˜omics systems, including transcriptomes, metagenomes and comparative genomics. Delivered via tutorials and hands-on activities, the course is assessed solely through practical assignments and spans topics including the dynamic nature of the genome through to sequence analysis, curation, annotation and data visualization. This introduction to computational analysis is geared towards biologists and assumes no previous knowledge or familiarity with computational methods.**
